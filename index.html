<p>Common knowledge has it that “Under Construction” pages are bad.</p>
<p>That’s okay then, because to be honest, this isn’t even under construction, because I don’t even know what will end up going here.</p>
<h2>Some ideas</h2>
<p>I’m gravitating to the idea that this site would serve as a central point for all my online stuff, which includes but isn’t limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A graveyard for my old blogs. I have a clear idea of where to go for this one — from possible tools, to how to export, to basically what it will look like in the end.</li>
<li>My RSS feeds.</li>
<li>Calendar?</li>
<li>Contacts?</li>
<li>Email?</li>
</ul>
